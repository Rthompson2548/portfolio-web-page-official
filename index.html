  <h3 class = "about">A little about me</h3>
  <!--description that shows your passion for web development/working with others -->
  <p>I wasn't introduced to the coding world until a few months ago, but I am already having so much fun learning about it and using it! I have spent the majority of my previous jobs working with others, which I can especially see as a useful skill when it comes to the number of skills needed to create a functional web page. I look forward to collaborating with other coders in the future!</p>
  <!--other interests -->
    <p>Outside of web development and my current job, I have a couple interests I pass the time with:</p> 
<!--ul list for interests-->
<ul>
  <li>Dogs! I have two dogs, and I spend as much time with them as I can.</li>
  <li>Coffee! I love trying new coffee drinks. Every week, my sister, brother-in-law and I go for a walk around the neighborhood and try a new coffee shop while we're out.</li>
</ul>
